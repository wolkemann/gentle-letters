            Today is all about Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. But these Socials
            are just huge shopping malls where people only showcase their best
            goods, the &quot;very best of&quot; of their lives.

            Real life is made of ups and downs, and when you are forced by
            competition to show only the best of you, then it becomes a
            manufactured, artificial thing, very far from what you really want
            to show to people.
